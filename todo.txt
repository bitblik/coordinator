- transaction to dispute state

- coordinator /admin/* for admin actions on allow pubkeys

- settle maker invoice after 4 hours even if not confirmed so that we can resolve conflict having the sats
- in taker screen show when maker received blik ( blikReceived -> blikSentToMaker)
- timer countdown of 2min for validity of blik code in both taker/maker screens with info what to do next.

- sign the api requests with priv key

- show coordinator/client version on UI
- better details on MakerSuccessScreen
- show details of invoice to pay (amount in sats + fees)
- save the failed payment reason (could not get an invoice from lnurl/ no route /??) and show it on takerFailedPayment screen
- backup of keys
- sound effects when status changes

======
- fidelity bond for taker
- NWC wallet integration
- WebLN for paying invoice with Alby extension
- re-generate new keys
- refactor to use websockets / nostr

======
- tests
- dark theme
- stats like https://plebqr.com/ for coordinator
- extract common code between coordinator & client (offer model)
- why it doesn't work well on mobile browsers (vanadium, ironfox) -> https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging
- other options except simplex (webpushs/telegram bot?)
