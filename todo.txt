- bad blik code on screen waiting for confirmation
- add all other transitions from workflow

- change expiration of make invoice to 24h
- settle maker invoice after x hours even if not confirmed so that we can resolve conflict having the sats
- in taker screen show when maker received blik ( blikReceived -> blikSentToMaker)
- timer countdown of 2min for validity of blik code in both taker/maker screens with info what to do next.

- sign the api requests with priv key

- better details on MakerSuccessScreen
- show details of invoice to pay (amount in sats + fees)
- save the failed payment reason (could not get an invoice from lnurl/ no route /??) and show it on takerFailedPayment screen
- backup of keys
- tests


- stats like https://plebqr.com/ for coordinator

- sound effects when status changes
- dark theme

- extract common code between coordinator & client (offer model)

- fidelity bond for taker
- NWC wallet integration
- WebLN for paying invoice with Alby extension
- re-generate new keys
- other options except simplex (webpushs/telegram bot?)

- refactor to use websockets / nostr
- why it doesn't work well on mobile browsers (vanadium, ironfox) -> https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging
