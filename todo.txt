- if status is takerPaymentFailed, show the offer in main screen with button redeem by submiting a bolt11 invoice
- paste on web
- show details of invoice to pay (amount in sats + fees)
- bad blik code on screen waiting for confirmation

- new offer status (settlingTakerInvoice), and handle it on taker screen showing payment in progress

- backup of keys
- re-generate new keys
- other options except simplex (element/webpushs/telegram bot?)
- save the failed payment reason (could not get an invoice from lnurl/ no route /??)

- refactor to use websockets / nostr
- why it doesn't work well on mobile browsers (vanadium, ironfox) -> https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging
