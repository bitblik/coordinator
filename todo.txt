- bad blik code on screen waiting for confirmation
- sign the api requests with priv key
- show details of invoice to pay (amount in sats + fees)
- comma instead of dot for Polish locale

- new offer status (payingTaker), and handle it on taker screen showing payment in progress

- sound effects when status changes
- dark theme

- NWC wallet integration
- fidelity bond for taker
- backup of keys
- re-generate new keys
- other options except simplex (element/webpushs/telegram bot?)
- save the failed payment reason (could not get an invoice from lnurl/ no route /??)

- refactor to use websockets / nostr
- why it doesn't work well on mobile browsers (vanadium, ironfox) -> https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging
