- 0.5% fees for taker as well

- new offer status (payingTaker), and handle it on taker screen showing payment in progress
- bad blik code on screen waiting for confirmation
- better details on MakerSuccessScreen
- show details of invoice to pay (amount in sats + fees)
- comma instead of dot for Polish locale
- WebLN for paying invoice with Alby extension
- save the failed payment reason (could not get an invoice from lnurl/ no route /??)


- stats like https://plebqr.com/ for coordinator

- sound effects when status changes
- dark theme

- extract common code between coordinator & client (offer model)

- sign the api requests with priv key
- NWC wallet integration
- fidelity bond for taker
- backup of keys
- re-generate new keys
- other options except simplex (element/webpushs/telegram bot?)

- refactor to use websockets / nostr
- why it doesn't work well on mobile browsers (vanadium, ironfox) -> https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/remote-debugging
